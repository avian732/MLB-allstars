# MLB-allstars
The shortened 2020 MLB season was an unconventional one in many ways. Teams were restricted to playing only clubs within their geographic division (e.g. East, West, Central), and several teams were threatened by virus outbreaks. Not to mention, the signature event of the regular season giving players a chance to reap the rewards of their effort and performance, the All-Star game, was unfortunately cancelled. This left fans to wonder which players from their teams would have earned the recognition of All-Star, and what could have been of an exciting matchup featuring the league’s best of the best. To honor the long-standing tradition of MLB All-Star games, this project seeks to determine which player statistics are most important in classifying an All-Star. Based on these results, select players will be venerated as 2020 “What Could Have Been” All-Stars.
